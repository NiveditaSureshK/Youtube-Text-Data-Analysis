The revolution of social media sites has also attracted the users towards video sharing sites, such as YouTube. The online users express their opinions or sentiments on the videos that they watch on such sites.

According to the latest YouTube statistics, the video-sharing platform has 2.6 billion users worldwide as of 2022 (Statista, 2022). It’s ranked as the second-most popular social network, and the only platform that has more active users than YouTube is Facebook. 

The objective is to automatically recognize and categorize opinions expressed in the comments to determine overall sentiment of the user.

Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experiences.
